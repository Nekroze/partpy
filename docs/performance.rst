Performance
-----------

``partpy`` is written with ``Cython`` support through .pxd files and can be
compiled for extra speed. If you do not want to use ``Cython`` simply install
it from the source with ``Cython`` uninstalled.

If however you use ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` or something similar
``Cython`` is marked a dependency and must be installed.
